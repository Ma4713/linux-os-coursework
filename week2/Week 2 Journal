This week, I focused on establishing a secure foundation for the Linux server and creating a simple test plan to assess system performance before making major changes. Instead of immediately applying security measures, I examined potential threats, selected the best precautions, and decided how to test and compare performance as the course progressed.

I'll use SSH to assess system performance remotely from the workstation, keeping the server headless and in line with real-world remote management. The testing will begin with baseline measurements while the system is idle, and then go to load testing for specific applications. After analysing the results to identify any bottlenecks, I will make optimisation modifications and retest to see how things improve. I'll monitor metrics like as CPU utilisation, RAM, disc I/O, network speed, system load, and service response times. Tools such as top, htop, free, vmstat, iostat, and network utilities will aid in data collection for each test.

I created a security checklist to outline the measures I'll implement over the next few weeks. These include making SSH more secure by enabling key-based authentication, disabling password logins, and restricting access to the workstation's IP address. I'll set up firewall rules to allow only necessary traffic and block everything else. To manage user capabilities, I'll disable direct root login and use a non-root administrator account with sudo access. I'll use AppArmor for access control, enable automatic security updates, and configure fail2ban to prevent repeated failed login attempts. These methods work together to create a solid, multi-layered security baseline that follows Linux server best practices.

To identify real system concerns, I developed a simple threat model. One major concern is SSH brute-force attacks, where someone tries to guess passwords to gain access. I'll reduce this risk by making SSH more secure, restricting access by IP address, and using fail2ban. Another issue is privilege escalation, where a compromised user account tries to gain root access. I'll prevent this by granting only essential permissions, strictly limiting sudo rights, and disabling direct root access. A third risk is running unnecessary services, which can expose the system to attacks. I'll address this by checking which services are running, stopping unneeded ones, applying firewall rules, and regularly scanning open ports.

In summary, this week showed me the importance of planning security and performance testing before making any changes. By identifying threats, solutions, and testing processes early, I can make changes and review the results more thoroughly and professionally later.
